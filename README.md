# genome_analysis

Welcome to my GitHub about the project based in the article The draft genome of tropical fruit durian (Durio zibethinus)!

My code for each step is found under "code" and in the wiki it is possible to read about all the parts of the project.

Home - the project plan and idea before the project was started. 

Process - in general when and in what order the different parts of the project has been done. 

Runs - information about each software, input and outputs for all the runs, my comments, answer to questions and conclusions. 

Best, 
Elin
